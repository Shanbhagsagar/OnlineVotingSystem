# Online Voting System

## Project Made by [@Shanbhagsagar](https://github.com/Shanbhagsagar) & [@TJohn00](https://github.com/TJohn00)

### About the project

- In this system people who are a voter can give his/her vote online without going to any physical polling station.
- There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of voters with complete information is stored.
- Registration is mainly done by the Admin for security reasons. The Admin can register the voter as well as the candidate on Admin panel and can simply fill Add Voter form or Add Candidate form to register voter or candidate. Students seeking registration are expected to contact the Admin to submit their details.
- After registration, the voter is assigned a Voter ID with which he/she can use to log into the system and enjoy services provided by the system such as voting.
- Admin & Student Module/Panel consists of an interface to login by using registered phone number stored in the database and using OTP. This OTP API removes the security risk that may arise from using a database stored password.
